### A little more about me:

I am a computer science graduate from the University of Piraeus, currently pursuing a Master's degree in Business Analytics at Athens University of Economics and Business. As a software engineer, I gained a solid foundation in programming and developed an Android app to detect emotion, gender, and age. Transitioning to a business analyst role, I offer a unique perspective in bridging technology and business to drive results.

As the saying goes, "From building code to building strategies, I traded my keyboard for a new set of tools." As a Software Engineer turned Business Analyst, I bring a unique perspective to the table, bridging the gap between technology and business to drive meaningful results. I am excited about the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, and I am confident that my skills and experiences make me a valuable asset to any organization.
